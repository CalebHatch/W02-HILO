This program allows the user to play a game where they guess if the next number in the sequence will be higher or lower, and are rewarded or deducted
points based on whether they can guess correctly.

Python should be installed in order to run this program.

The project structure is basic. The only file necessary to play the game is W02Prove.py, and it should be in the root directory.
